# Drag & Drop To-Do Board

A simple Kanban-style task manager built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and dnd-kit
.
Tasks can be created, deleted, and dragged across columns, with state saved in localStorage.

## MVP (Completed)

Static Kanban board with 3 columns:

- To-Do

- In Progress

- Completed

- Add tasks with a text input

- Delete tasks with confirmation modal

Drag & drop tasks between columns and reorder within columns (using dnd-kit)

Persist tasks in browser localStorage

Dark/Light mode toggle with persistence

## Enhancements (Planned)

Editable column names and colors

Task detail modal (description, due date, etc.)

Task priority labels (Low, Medium, High)

## Advanced Features (Future)

Support for multiple boards

Authentication (Supabase/Firebase)

Cloud database sync

Real-time collaboration (WebSockets / Supabase realtime)

## BUGS TO FIX AND AREAS TO IMPROVE

- Toggle dark mode not working properly: still need to grasp the latest version of vite.
- State management; the up is built so far using states which at some point don't look that pretty. So the use of context or state management tools is one of the go for
